## About Me

I'm a seasoned pro in the finance and hospitality arenas with over 20 years of experience navigating the market's highs and lows. But guess what? I've decided to hit the reset button and dive into the thrilling world of technology! 🚀

Imagine a seasoned captain swapping the ship's helm for a spaceship's cockpit. I'm on a galactic quest, charting unknown territories and decoding the mysteries of IT. 

Here are the three cosmic regions I'm most excited to explore:
1. ☁️ **Cloud Computing** - Where I'm floating on virtual clouds, building scalable solutions.
2. 🤖 **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** - Crafting smart algorithms that might one day outsmart me!
3. 📊 **Data Science** - Turning data into insightful stories, like a modern-day digital alchemist.

I am diving head first on this adventure through lines of code, debugging dilemmas, and the occasional coffee spill.

And remember, if you need a blend of old-school wisdom and fresh tech enthusiasm, I'm your go-to person. Let's innovate and make some tech magic happen!
